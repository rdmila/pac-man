# Pac-man game
Written in Python using Tkinter

## How to run
### First way
Run **run.sh**

### Second way
1. Install dependencies 
```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run main.py
```shell
python3 main.py
```

## What it does
Opens a window with the game! 

Controls: change direction of pac-man using arrows on a keyboard.

If a pacman (yellow circle) collides a ghost (red circle), then the window becomes red and a program terminates.
